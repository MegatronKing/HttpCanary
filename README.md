# HttpCanary

Hello everyone, HttpCanary was renamed to [Reqable](https://reqable.com) 🚀🚀🚀.

The new app is not just for Android, but for Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, and iOS. Not just debugging proxy, but also REST API Client 🐮🍺.

**Reqable = Fiddler + Charles + Postman**

Reqable implements the core features of traffic analysis and REST client, and deeply integrates them. One app is worth multiple apps💰.
